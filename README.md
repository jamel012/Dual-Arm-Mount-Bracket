# Dual-Arm-Mount-Bracket

This project consists of a 3D-modeled mechanical bracket designed to serve as a dual-arm mounting structure. It's commonly used in robotics, camera gimbal systems, or custom hinge-based assemblies requiring secure rotational motion on two parallel joints.

## 📐 Features

- **Two Parallel Arms:** Each side includes a circular housing with holes designed for rotational joints or fasteners.
- **Base Mount:** A flat circular base with 4 countersunk holes allows for easy and stable mounting to a surface or platform.
- **Structural Integrity:** Curved arm design provides additional strength and resistance to bending.
- **Bolt Compatibility:** Hexagon recesses for M3/M4 bolts (adjustable based on final application).
- **Customizable Dimensions:** Easy to scale or modify for specific use cases.

## 🧰 Applications

- Robotic arm joints
- Servo or motor mounts
- Camera gimbals or FPV platforms
- Sensor bracket assemblies

## 🛠️ File Information

- **Format:** 3D CAD (.step, .stl, or .f3d)
- **Software Used:** (e.g. Fusion 360, SolidWorks, Onshape — specify yours)
- **Export Compatibility:** Ready for 3D printing or CNC manufacturing

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Import the file into your preferred CAD software.
2. Customize the hole sizes or arm dimensions if needed.
3. Export as STL for 3D printing or DXF for CNC.
4. Assemble with compatible fasteners and rotating joints.

## 📏 Recommended Printing Settings

- **Material:** PLA / PETG / ABS
- **Layer Height:** 0.2 mm
- **Infill:** 30% or higher
- **Supports:** Enabled (under arm overhangs)
- **Wall Count:** 3+ for extra strength
